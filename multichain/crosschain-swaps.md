# Crosschain Swaps

Crosschain swaps enable seamless token exchanges across multiple blockchain networks. By accessing liquidity beyond a single chain, these swaps open up advanced trading strategies—most notably, arbitrage and enhanced liquidity provision.

## Why Use Crosschain Swaps?

### Arbitrage Opportunities

Price discrepancies between tokens on different blockchains can occur due to market segmentation or varying liquidity conditions. Crosschain swaps allow traders to quickly move assets between chains to exploit these differences, capturing arbitrage profits that would otherwise be unavailable on a single network.

### Enhanced Liquidity Provision

For liquidity providers, crosschain swaps offer access to a broader array of liquidity pools. By tapping into multiple chains, providers can:
- **Reduce Slippage:** Trade in chains with more profitable liquidity pool opportunities.
- **Optimize Fee Structures:** Benefit from more competitive fee rates across networks.
- **Increase Capital Efficiency:** Allocate assets strategically to the chains offering the best market conditions.

## Underlying Benefits from Cross-Chain Interoperability

The technology powering crosschain swaps leverages robust cross-chain messaging protocols such as LayerZero, Axelar, and CCIP. While these protocols are often highlighted for bridging, their capabilities also underpin the efficiency of crosschain swaps:

- **Lower Transaction Costs:** CCIP, in particular, is known for its stable gas estimation and lower fees, making swaps cost effective.
- **Reliable Execution:** Recent updates to protocols like LayerZero have resolved earlier gas estimation issues, ensuring that swaps execute reliably.
- **Network Redundancy:** In configurations where multiple lanes are available (as seen in dual lane setups for liquid assets), the combination of providers helps maintain high reliability and operational continuity.

## Best Practices for Leveraging Crosschain Swaps

- **Provider Selection:** For single lane operations—such as swapping assets tied to veSOLID NFTs—CCIP is recommended for its cost efficiency and predictable gas usage. LayerZero serves as a strong alternative where needed.
- **Market Analysis:** Prior to executing swaps, perform a thorough market assessment to identify optimal arbitrage opportunities and evaluate liquidity conditions across chains.
- **Risk Management:** Understand the operational nuances of each protocol. In scenarios where gas estimation issues might arise (especially during periods of high network congestion), consider manual gas adjustments or alternative provider options to safeguard swap execution.

By integrating crosschain swaps into your trading or liquidity provision strategy, you can capitalize on inter-chain price variations and access deeper liquidity, ultimately enhancing profitability and capital efficiency in the evolving DeFi landscape.
