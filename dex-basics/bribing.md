# ðŸ’° Bribing

One big advantage about Solidly is that protocols looking to bootstrap or deepen liquidity can do so in a very capital efficient and user friendly manner by bribing. Solidly natively supports 2 types of bribes:

* Voter Bribes
* LP Bribes

Voter bribes are paid directly to veSOLID holders on a pro-rata basis. Voters are incentivized to vote for pools with voter bribes attached (as it increases their voting APR), which in turn allocates SOLID emissions to those pools.

Bribers looking to directly bootstrap liquidity in any whitelisted token can do so via direct LP bribes. For example: Protocol Y wants to deepen liquidity in Y/wETH but wants LPs to directly earn Y token (not SOLID), said protocol can achieve this by creating LP bribes with token Y.
