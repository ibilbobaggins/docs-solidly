# üó≥Ô∏è Voting Process

## Process Flow of Voting

1. Lock SOLID (ERC-20) into a veSOLID NFT (ERC-721) for 1 week - 4 years
2. Vote for specific liquidity pools (e.g. USDC-WETH)
3. Collect voter bribes & fees **only** from pools you voted on

## Reward Flow of Voting

There are 2 types of rewards that voters benefit from:

* Voter bribes
* Trading fees

Voter bribes are always deposited prior to the epoch starting. Voters who vote for a pair with voter bribes will be able to claim such bribes on a pro-rata basis instantly after the epoch has flipped (always Thursdays 00:00:00am UTC). The trading fees have obviously not been generated yet at that point, they become claimable as they stream in. We recommend claiming trading fees once you've accumulated enough so that gas cost to claim becomes negligible.
