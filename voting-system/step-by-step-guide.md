# ⚙️ Step-by-Step Guide

In order to vote you first need a `veSOLID` NFT, for which you will need to lock `SOLID`.

## Step 1: Acquire SOLID

Visit [https://solidly.com/swap](https://solidly.com/swap) to acquire SOLID

## Step 2: Vest SOLID in to veSOLID

Visit [https://solidly.com/vest/create](https://solidly.com/vest/create) and lock your SOLID, locking it for 4 years gives you 100% voting & earning power, that power scales down linearly.\

## Step 4: Earn

Wait for the epoch to flip, voter bribes will be claimable immediately after the epoch flips and trading fees can be claimed as they accrue in real-time throughout the week. All rewards can be claimed on [https://solidly.com/rewards](https://solidly.com/rewards)

## Alternative via OTC

veSOLID can also be acquired by NFT trading. There's less liquidity, but users might be able to find an attractive deal. The Solidly platform does not currently offer a NFT marketplace and existing platforms such as OpenSea do not offer proper security for financial NFT ("fNFT") transactions, as such we recommend any transfers only to be made through trusted escrows.
