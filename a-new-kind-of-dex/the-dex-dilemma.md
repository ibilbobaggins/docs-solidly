# ⁉️ The DEX Dilemma

When considering decentralized exchanges and evaluating their performance indicators, people almost universally think of:

* TVL
* Volume

In that order.

### The Potential Misleading Nature of TVL:

Liquidity may remain relatively inactive. Numerous Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools exist with dozens or even _hundreds of millions_ in TVL, yet they might only experience average daily trading volumes of several hundred thousand dollars or even less, sometimes creating less than $100 in daily fees despite substantial capital commitment.

### The Potential Misleading Nature of Volume**:**

Volume does not inherently signify value creation as fees may be minimal (or zero), or volume could be influenced by wash trading.

### Optimal Indicator for DEX Performance:

The most reliable indicator is 'Fees'. This metric illustrates what users are willing to pay to utilize the platform and is resistant to manipulation due to its cost-prohibitive nature. It remains a genuine indicator since predominant focus typically lies on TVL and Volume, which are more susceptible to gaming.

### Case Study to Demonstrate TVL Efficiency:

Data from [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/gammastrategies/Uniswap-v3-Volume-and-Fees-Collected) reveals that in a 7-day period in October 2022, Uniswap generated $4.51M in fees, of which the top 30 pairs contributed $3.56M or 79.03%. Those top pairs only account for $1.11B or 31.31% of its total TVL, indicating that the other $2.44B (or 68.68% of TVL) are mostly underutilized.\
This underscores that TVL can exhibit varying degrees of efficiency.

**Decentralized exchanges today don't manage to effectively bring together all of its parts into a symbiotic relationship to create the maximum amount value for its stakeholders**

**Examples:**

* UNI holders receive 0% fees, while incentivizing liquidity and experiencing dilution
* xSUSHI does not earn any fees as of late, while incentivizing liquidity and getting diluted
* veCRV holders receive 50% of protocol fees, some from pools they're not voting for, enabling inefficient allocations of protocol incentives
* No existing DEX provides dilution protection
