# 📈 Emission Schedule

The emission schedule of the re-launched protocol on Ethereum would take on the following curve:

However, in reality it will take on a slightly different shape. Due to our special circumstances of not launching a new protocol, we have created a boosted emission phase of 16 weeks in order to bootstrap liquidity on Solidly during the re-launch phase and to allow people easier entry into our ecosystem. In aggregate the total amount emitted doesn't change, it just changes the speed of emission by a little in the end.

The emission boost effect looks dramatic, but if we compare the emissions after the boost by overlaying them, we can see that the effect is minimal.

It will take around 10 years to reach 99% of the max cap. The minting algorithm is designed in such a way that it will never actually reach the maximum supply, as it approaches the limit asymptotically.
