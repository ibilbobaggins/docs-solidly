# ➡️ Purpose of $SOLID

The main purpose of the `SOLID` ERC-20 token is to incentivize liquidity providers on Solidly.

The `SOLID` tokens that are entering the market through liquidity providers can then be purchased and transformed into financial NFTs (ERC-721). Users who acquire such NFTs then have the possibility of:

* Earning
* Voting
* Boosting
* Governing

## Earning

`veSOLID` earns 20% of the trading fees that the Solidly protocol generates, furthermore `veSOLID` earns 100% of the bribes that are made by various protocols looking to bootstrap liquidity on the Solidly platform.

## Voting

`veSOLID` holders can vote which pools to incentivize each week with `SOLID` emissions on a pro-rata basis and receive instantly paid out bribes in return ("cash for vote").

## Boosting

Another perk of owning `veSOLID` is the ability to boost your rewards on provided liquidity. Vote locking `SOLID` allows you to earn a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity you are providing on Solidly.

**This feature is paused during the growth phase of the Solidly platform.**

## Governing

Adding to the list of `veSOLID` benefits is the ability to shape the future of the Solidly platform, such as choosing technical pool parameters, operators or elect governance. As for boosting, the on-chain governance will be enabled in the future once Solidly has been fully boostrapped.
