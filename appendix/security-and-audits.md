# 🔐 Security & Audits

Solidly has been written by industry experts. Previously our developers have worked as core contributors for blue-chip protocols such as Uniswap, Fixed Forex and Yearn Finance, bringing with them a tremendous amount of expertise, especially in fields of security.

Solidly underwent several third-party audits, the scopes of which were LP safety (user deposits). You can find the audits here: [links.md](../resources/links.md "mention")

It’s worth noting that audits don’t eliminate risks entirely, see more at [#security](legal.md#security "mention")
