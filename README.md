## Background

Solidly was first established in February 2022 by DeFi pioneer Andre Cronje on the Fantom network and subsequently forked with a 93% consensus & re-launched on Ethereum by a small group of degens in December 2022. Solidly aims to become the most capital-efficient decentralized exchange in the DeFi landscape. It achieves this by improving upon existing AMM primitives and rounding everything off with a (3,3)-inspired incentive layer.
